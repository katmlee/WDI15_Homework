    <h2> Who are these badasses and why should we care? </h2>
    <p> Computer Science is a field dominated by the male population.Why? Well maybe it's because boys had a leg up playing with computer games in the 70s or maybe because of the intimdation factor. Either way, it's great to have female badasses in computer science to look up to. These women created the first algorithm for a machine, developed compilers, and founded institutions for women in technology. That's why you should give a shit.

      <h2>Statistics on Women in Computer Science</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> <p>In the US, women earn 57% of all undergradute degrees, yet only 18% of undergraduate degrees are in computer and information science degrees.</p> </li>
          <li><p>In 1984, 37.1% of Computer Science degrees were awarded to women; the percentage dropped to 29.9% in 1989-1990, and 26.7% in 1997-1998.</p></li>
          <li><p>A National Public Radio report in 2013 stated that about 20% of all U.S. computer programmers are female.</p></li>
